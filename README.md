# GoalBasedFoodie

Many a times when all I need is a quick fix for lunch, I end up spending half an hour hopping around the eateries in my neighbourhood unable to decide on that one place. 
Frustrated by that experience, I created this app that pulls together all the wonderful foodie hangouts in your area.
You can choose either to satisfy the growling tummy at a click of a button or to devise a long-term eating plan that brings you to a different place every meal, every day.

Tech used: React + Redux, ES6, Bootstrap, SASS 

APIs: Foursquare, Google

Future work:
1. Embeded Directions from your location to your chosen venue for "Quick fix" (Google Maps)
2. Export "Eating plan" to your Calender (Coronofy)
3. Upload currently unlisted venues so that you can include them in your plan (Foursquare OAuth2)
