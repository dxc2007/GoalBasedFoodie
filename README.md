# GoalBasedFoodie

Many a times when all I need is a quick fix for lunch, I end up spending half an hour hopping around the eateries in my neighbourhood unable to decide on that one place. 
Frustrated by that experience, I created this app that pulls together all the wonderful foodie places in your area.
You can choose either to satisfy the growling tummy or to devise a long-term eating plan that brings you to a different place for every meal every day
